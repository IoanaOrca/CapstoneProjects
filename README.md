Some projects in python.

1. Fibonacci Sequence - Enter a number and have the program generate the Fibonacci sequence to that number or to the Nth number.
2. Prime Factorization - Have the user enter a number and find all Prime Factors (if there are any) and display them.
3. Next Prime Number - Have the program find prime numbers until the user chooses to stop asking for the next one.
4. Find Cost of Tile to Cover W x H Floor - Calculate the total cost of tile it would take to cover a floor plan of width and height, using a cost entered by the user.
