# CapstoneProjects
Some projects in python.

1. Fibonacci Sequence - Enter a number and have the program generate the Fibonacci sequence to that number or to the Nth number.
2. Prime Factorization - Have the user enter a number and find all Prime Factors (if there are any) and display them.
3. Next Prime Number - Have the program find prime numbers until the user chooses to stop asking for the next one.
